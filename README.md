### Makers Academy Week No. 5

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KatHicks/fizzbuzz_javascript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KatHicks/fizzbuzz_javascript) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/KatHicks/fizzbuzz_javascript/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/KatHicks/fizzbuzz_javascript)

### Instructions

We worked through three challenges this week (of which this is the first) in order to get familiar with JavaScript.

### Objectives

* Are you having fun?
* Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?
* **Can you learn a new language and its patterns?**

### Using my application

* Code base is just an implementation of the FizzBuzz Kata
  * As such, not much code for interaction

### Running the tests

* Download the repo using `$ git clone`
* Open up the `SpecRunner.html` file in the browser to see the results of the tests

### Dependencies

* Written using **JavaScript**
* Tested with **Jasmine**

### Approach

* Used the prototype pattern
  * Fizzbuzz is declared as an object and then a play function is added on to the object using `prototype`

### Reflections

* Was really interesting getting to grips with a new language
* Was quite daunting at first realising that concepts don't always carry through to other programming languages
  * Found the lack of classes in JavaScript (not including ES6) quite confusing at first
